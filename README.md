# AS5047_upwork

# Project Logistics

1. "Arduino" folder has a working code for as5047.
2. For the project setup with CubeIDE, please follow: https://youtu.be/eFKeNPJq50g for the pin settings, and SPI.
3. However, for the SPI setting, please change according to the AS5047 documentation.
4. Create your own solution to "stm_32_nucleo_f446re_your_solution" folder
5. Once you think the code would work, we will have a zoom screen share to final check with my board. I think it should be less than 30 minutes or so.
6. I do not need any overall/fancy libary to build. I need to check the very simple SPI protocol works at the moment. Just like in the arduino code example.
